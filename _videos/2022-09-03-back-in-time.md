Lyrics:

Miami equals black mask, black clothes
With a little bit of rope to tie, I flipped it
Black suits, white shirts, black glasses with a matching tie
Like Agent J or Agent K, and I wish the whole world would
Ok, I'm tryin' make a billion out of 15 cents
Understand, understood
I'm a go-getter, mover, shaker, culture, bury a boarder, record-breaker won't cha
Give credit where credit is due don't cha
Know that I don't give a number two
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future we have to go back in time

Baby, ohhh baby
Ohhh baby, my sweet baby
You're the one

-Pitbull #BackInTime #Vevo
