From Russia with love I fly to you,

much wiser since my goodbye to you

I’ve travelled the world to learn,

I must return from Russia with love.



I’ve seen places, faces and smiled for a moment,

but oh, you haunted me so.

Still my tongue tied young pride,

would not let my love for you show

In case you’d say no.



To Russia I flew but there and then,

I suddenly knew you’d care again

My running around is through,

I fly to you from Russia with love.
