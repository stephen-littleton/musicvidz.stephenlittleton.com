Title : Soulshaker (Radio Edit)
Artist : Max Linen
Label : Phonetic Recordings 
Cat. No. : PH42

Written and produced by Leiam Sullivan & Rob Roar with Keithen Carter on Vocals, the track went onto become the biggest record of Ibiza that summer topping Pete Tong’s Radio 1 ‘Ibiza Buzz Chart’ and hitting the top spot for every DJ on the White Isle. Heavily championed by pretty much every Tastemaker DJ out there.

‘The Soulshaker’ stamped it’s mark as the Space Terrace & Manumission Anthem with live performances of the track at the closing parties of both clubs. The guys also performed live for MTV (track was ‘A’ Listed) and Channel 4’s Pop World. Something pretty unheard of for an underground record
