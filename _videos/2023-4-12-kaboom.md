Lyrics:  

Life is like a game  
You gotta choose a side  
And try to play  
Before you lose your mind  
And fade away  
You could soon be gone  

Who's it gonna be?  
You gotta tell yourself  
"It's them or me"  
And you can justify most anything  
So who's side are you on?  
Pawn  

Chorus:  
Well one day they'll drop the bomb  
Who knows who they'll drop it on?  
Maybe someone that you love  
So before they get to you  
Do what you gotta do  
KABOOM!  

Don't try to say  
That we could win it all some other way  
Pride will never fall  
And never change  
You better toe the line  

Cuz in the end  
The only thing on which you can depend  
To attack is safer than defend  
Look out for I me mine  
Blind  

Chorus  

Pick which side you're on  
Drop the bomb (x6)  

Well one day they'll drop the bomb  
Who knows who they'll drop it on?  
Maybe someone that you love  
Don't wait for the evidence  

No one's really innocent  
Send the judgment from above  
And before they get to you  
Do what you gotta do  

KABOOM!
