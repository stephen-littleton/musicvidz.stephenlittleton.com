Lyrics:  

Shadows grow so long before my eyes  
And they're moving across the page  
Suddenly the day turns into night  
Far away from the city  

But don't hesitate  
'Cause your love, your love won't wait ho-no-no  

Ooh baby I love your way every day  
Ooh wanna tell you I love your way every day  
Ooh wanna be with you night and day  

Hey yeah  
I love your way
