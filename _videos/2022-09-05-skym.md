Do you still feed the animal

Animal finger

Finger on the phone

Curve around corners

Do you still feed the animal


Your muffled voices

Up this ideal head


And the wires come in

Open us

Close us

(slide beneath the city)


Slide beneath the city

And the feet in the streets above us

(and your voice again)


And your voice again

(and your voice again)

(and your voice again)


I don't want you to call again

Do you still feed the animal

Muffled madness


Quiet calm pervade her

I couldn't go through this again

You said you love her


You know you love her

You never want to be without her


You said you never want hurt her

You know you hurt her

I


How many lives you lives

How many hurt you done

How many times you come to this place

How much you want it

You said you love her
