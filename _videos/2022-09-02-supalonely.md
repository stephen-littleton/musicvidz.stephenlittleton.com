LYRICS: 
I know I fucked up I'm just a loser shouldn’t be with ya guess I’m a quitter 
  
while ur out there drinking I’m just here thinking bout where I should’ve been  
  
(I been lonely mm aah yeah) 
  
Water pouring down from the ceiling  
I knew this would happen 
  
Still hard to believe it  
Maybe I’m dramatic  
I don’t wanna seem it  
I don’t wanna panic  

I’m a sad girl  
In this big world 
It’s a mad world  
  
All of my friends  
Know what’s happened 
You’re a bad thing  
  
(Grrrr) 
  
I know I fucked up I'm just a loser shouldn’t be with ya guess I’m a quitter 
  
while ur out there drinking I’m just here thinking bout where I should’ve been  
  
(I been lonely mm aah yeah) 
  
Lalalala lalalala lonely  
(I’m a lonely bitch)  
Lalalala lalalala lonely  
(SupaLonely) 
  
Now I’m in the bathtub crying  
Think I’m slowly sinking  
  
Bubbles in ma eyes now  
Maybe I’m just dreaming  
  
Now I’m in the sad club  
Just tryna get a back rub

I’m a sad girl  
In this big world 
It’s a mad world  
  
All of my friends  
Know what’s happened 
You’re a bad thing  
  
(Grrrr) 
  
I know I fucked up I'm just a loser shouldn’t be with ya guess I’m a quitter 
  
while ur out there drinking I’m just here thinking bout where I should’ve been  
  
(I been lonely mm aah yeah) 
  
Lalalala lalalala lonely  
(I’m a lonely bitch)  
Lalalala lalalala lonely  
(SupaLonely) 

(Gus Dapperton verse) I loathe romancing in itself yea I’d be damned to try I’m only dancing by myself so I don't slam my Irish buck compostable cups b-b-benee i can't stress this enough I would hate to mess things up but my boogie still stays restless as fuck 
  
I know I fucked up I'm just a loser shouldn’t be with ya guess I’m a quitter 
  
while ur out there drinking I’m just here thinking bout where I should’ve been  
  
(I been lonely mm aah yeah) 
  
Lalalala lalalala lonely  
(I’m a lonely bitch)  
Lalalala lalalala lonely  
(SupaLonely)
