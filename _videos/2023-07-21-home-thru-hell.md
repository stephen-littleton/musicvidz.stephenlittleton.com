Lyrics: Riding along through the Deap Vally where the dragons of madness roam  
Carrying my story on my Yamaha back home  
I could hear the screaming vultures screaming out my name  
Not knowing I was lost along this long, bad highway  

I ﬁnally made it home thru hell  
Under the hypnotizer’s spell  
I ﬁnally made it home through hell  
I hope I live to tell  
I ﬁnally made it  

I gladly accept your invitation because I sent it to myself  
Prepare for my arrival  
Stock the fridge and ﬁll the shelf  
And I bring treasure from a lifetime in California  
We can build, we can break  
Tete-a-tete, give and take, getting philosophical  

I ﬁnally made it home thru hell  
Under the hypnotizer’s spell  
I ﬁnally made it home through hell  
I hope I live to tell  
I ﬁnally made it  

Oh I think I tried too hard to shut the mouth of doom  
Taking all my wisdom from the ﬂaming lips of youth  
Now I feel my rapper’s heart and think with my baby’s brain  
And I still ride my Yamaha, but everything else is changed  

I ﬁnally made it home thru hell  
Under the hypnotizer’s spell  
I ﬁnally made it home through hell  
I hope I live to tell  
I ﬁnally made it
