Hercules & Love Affair’s video for their standout single “Do You Feel The Same”, from their third album 'The Feast of the Broken Heart', looks like a couture Mad Max. Set in a desolate, post-apocalyptic landscape, the video features performances from contemporary ballet dancer and choreographer Josh Johnson. Hercules & Love Affair’s Andy Butler drafted in renowned fashion designer Bernhard Willhelm, who has previously worked together with Bjork, to give the video its distinctive fluorescent tribal look. Directed by AlexandLianne, the video was shot with infra-red cameras, giving this party at the end of the world a strange but vibrant hue.
