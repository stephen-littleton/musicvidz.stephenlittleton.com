From Goldfish's long-awaited third studio album comes the first single with the same title; 'Get Busy Living'. 

Ever wondered what really happens to your bag once its been checked in at the airport? So did we. The answer is clear: its getting busy living, having affairs with other similarly-cute bags and globe-hopping. Your bag doesn't go missing - its just been partying with other bags on foreign soil.

Blissful uplifting pianos, an absolutely huge chorus, all tied up with a slamming beat. Featuring the honeyed vocals of super-talent Emily Bruce, "This track took us completely by surprise. It morphed from a jam we had during a gig and just opened up into a full song...All the best ideas seem to happen to us when we aren't trying to make something. As soon as you try... you're screwed!" muses Dom.

"I don't want to live like I've already lived, but I do want to get busy living!"
