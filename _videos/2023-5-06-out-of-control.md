Lyrics below:  
We're out of control  
Out of control  
Out of control  
Out of control  
Out of control  
Sometimes I feel that I'm misunderstood  
The river's runnin' deep right through my blood  
Your naked body's lying on the ground  
You always get me up when I'm down  
And it always seems we're runnin' out of time  
The river's runnin' deep right through my blood  
(The river's runnin' deep right through my blood)  
And maybe that I'm just scared of losin' you  
Or maybe it's the things you make me do  
The record player keeps on  
Turning round  
It could be stuck or maybe  
It's a sound  
It seems to me we both should  
Hang around  
Out of control  
We're out of control  
We're out of control  
(Out of control)  
Out of control  
(Like we're just so carefree and  
Free-spirited and they don't give a  
It's what's I love)  
Somehow you have to give in, you know  
That's how we see it, surrender
