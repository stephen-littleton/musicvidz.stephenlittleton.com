Bang bang, na na na na na
Bang bang, na na na na na
Oh my god, think I'm in trouble (oh)

Ooh, you showed up and made me wonder
Looking fun but kinda dangerous too
Yeah, yeah, ooh-ooh, I got lifted off the ground
I don't know what you done but it's just too good (Oh, yeah)

Ooh, you got something, think I want it
Guess I never felt the way that I do
Yeah, when I'm with you, you
It's so hard to see through you, and that's why I want it

Bang bang, look what you started
Bang bang, straight to my heart
Skipped a beat, you feel like trouble (Oh)
Bang bang, baby, I got it
Bad bad, look what you started
Oh my god, think I'm in trouble

Bang bang, na na na na na
Bang bang, na na na na na
Oh my god, think I'm in trouble
Bang bang, na na na na na
Bang bang, na na na na na
Oh my god, think I'm in trouble

Ooh, what's the core of our connection?
Is it just that I know I'm bound to lose? (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh, you're a fire, my obsession
And want all of your devotion for good, yeah

Ooh, you got something, think I want it
Guess I never felt the way that I do
Yeah, when I'm with you, you
It's so hard to see through you, and that's why I want it

Bang bang, look what you started
Bang bang, straight to my heart
Skipped a beat, you feel like trouble (Oh)
Bang bang, baby, I got it
Bad bad, look what you started
Oh my god, think I'm in trouble

Bang bang, na na na na na
Bang bang, na na na na na
Oh my god, think I'm in trouble
Bang bang, na na na na na
Bang bang, na na na na na
Oh my god, think I'm in trouble

Ooh-ooh (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Ooh-ooh, you got something, think I want it
Guess I never felt the way that I do, yeah
When I'm with you, you, it's so hard to see through you
(See through you)
And that's why I want it

Bang bang, look what you started
Bang bang, straight to my heart
Skipped a beat, you feel like trouble (Oh)
Bang bang, baby, I got it
Bad bad, look what you started
Oh my god, think I'm in trouble

Bang bang, na na na na na
Bang bang, na na na na na
