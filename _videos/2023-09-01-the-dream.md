Figurehead of Berlin institution Keinemusik Adam Port and Mexican electronic innovator Theus Mago join forces on a collective debut for Defected Records ‘The Dream’. A glowing, otherworldly cut featuring an evocative vocal from Columbian vocalist Martina Camargo, steady beats, intricate percussion and Latin-inspired drum patterns form an irresistible backdrop to her soaring vocal. With a transcendent soulfulness that offsets the tougher elements of the record, the track’s title ‘The Dream’ feels exceptionally fitting, warm and emotive while retaining plenty of dancefloor muscle.
