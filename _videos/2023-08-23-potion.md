Lyrics:  
In the whip on a Tuesday night   
Got the music high  
And you by my side side  
Top down and the moon is high  
And the mood is right  
And you by my side side  
 
Late night conversations  
Electric emotions  
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex  
And it’s a potion  
Late night bodies aching  
Mental stimulation  
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex appeal  
And its a moment  
 
I been catching love off a back-board  
Running from your love that’s what this track for  
Fuckin every bitch and never tell ‘em no  
I’m pushin p they black and white an oreo  
I been catching love off a back-board  
Running from your love that’s what this track for  
Buying n****s bitches from the corner store  
Thug why you wanna do that I don’t need this love  
Ball like LeBron James in the finals  
We 14-hundred just like a minor  
I’m yelling ‘Free Big Meech’ with designers  
15 million hoes cause I’m undecided  
I’m kicking shit karate ohhhh  
I’m serving bricks in somebody hood  
Fucked a bitch catch a charlie ohhhh  
Gucci flip flops and joggers ooohhh  
 
In the whip on a Tuesday night   
Got the music high  
And you by my side side  
Top down and the moon is high  
And the mood is right  
And you by my side side  
 
Late night conversations Electric emotions  
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex  
And it’s a potion  
Late night bodies aching  
Mental stimulation  
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex appeal  
And its a moment  
 
Feeling fly tonight, yeah... yeah  
Going with the motherf******g vibe... yeah  
It’s going down tonight, oh yeah
Don’t you leave don’t you move, bada bing bada boom bout you  
 
In the whip on a Tuesday night   
Got the music high  
And you by my side side  
Top down and the moon is high  
And the mood is right  
And you by my side side  
 
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex  
And it’s a potion  
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex appeal  
And its a moment
