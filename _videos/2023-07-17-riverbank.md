One of 2016â€™s most promising deep house artists Bolier on top of his game here alongside Mingue. Both know their way with sympathetic songs, as proven by Riverbank (Youâ€™re So Damn Beautiful), a track that blends catchy deep house with nice guitar chords and sweet pop vocals. The end result touches heart and soul, while the groove still keeps those floors moving.
