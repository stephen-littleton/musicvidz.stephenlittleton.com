About Bad Boy Entertainment:  

In 1993, Sean “Puff Daddy” Combs, also known as Diddy, launched Bad Boy Records. Nobody could have imagined the impact the label would have on pop culture. As a subsidiary of the larger Bad Boy Entertainment, the label became best known for its signature sound of streetwise hip-hop soul and the ghetto fabulousness that radiated like precious jewels from its very name. Bad Boy was designed for those who aspired higher, but also wanted to party until the break of dawn. Puffy had seen life from both sides of the class divide and, with his groove-heavy music, worked hard to merge the two. There is no better visual embodiment of this merger than the groundbreaking videos that were in heavy rotation on BET and MTV and now on YouTube.  

The Bad Boy Entertainment channel is the official YouTube home of iconic music videos from Puff Daddy, Craig Mack, Faith Evans, 112, Total, Mase, Yung Joc, Cassie, Danity Kane, and the rest of the Bad Boy Family, and your destination for some of the biggest 90s and 00s hip-hop hits of all time like Craig Mack’s “Flava In Your Ear (Remix)”, the Notorious B.I.G. tribute “I’ll Be Missing You” by Puff Daddy feat. Faith Evans and 112, and Cassie – “Me & U”.
