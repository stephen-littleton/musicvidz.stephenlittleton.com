Lyrics:  
I can’t read the room  
It ain’t written your face  
I can’t patch it up  
Fight almost every day  
We could draw it out  
But we’re talking underwater  
Forgive, forget  
At least that’s  
Moving forward  
 
Another night at home  
Away from the fizz  
Who could‘ve guessed?  
That wasn’t it  
You’re obsessed  
Think you’re the star of the show  
Now look who it is  
A hypocrite  
A hypocrite  

God damn  
Whats the big deal?  
If it’s what you call love  
Then I’m digging my heels  
You’re lukewarm  
What’s the appeal?  
Now the curtain pulls back  
I’m waiting for the big reveal  

You act so nonchalant  
A hero in your play  
Half the seats are empty  
Reviews were not too great  
There’s no dry eye here  
You know we’re just pretending  
Anti climax  
That’s a wrap  
And a ragic ending  

Another night at home  
Away from the fizz  
Who could‘ve guessed?  
That wasn’t it  
You’re obsessed  
Think you’re the star of the show  
Now look who it is  
A hypocrite  
A hypocrite  

God damn  
Whats the big deal?  
If it’s what you call love  
Then I’m digging my heels  
You’re lukewarm  
What’s the appeal?  
Now the curtain pulls back  
I’m waiting for the big reveal  

And so you contradict  
Like Molière depicts  
A hypocrite  
A hypocrite  
You can’t admit  
Your big reveal’s a miss  
I almost fell for it  
You hypocrite  
You hypocrite  

God damn  
Whats the big deal?  
If it’s what you call love  
Then I’m digging my heels  
You’re lukewarm  
What’s the appeal?  
Now the curtain pulls back  
I can’t stop saying  

Oh, God damn  
Whats the big deal?  
If it’s what you call love  
Then I’m digging my heels  
You’re lukewarm  
What’s the appeal?  
Now the curtain pulls back  
I’m waiting for the big reveal
