LYRICS: 

What I feel lately is 50 shades of hate me, and I cant seem to break free I don’t like what I’m feelin’ maybe My self medicating At the point of breaking I’m not sure if you’re relating I just need to feel like I’m the one worth saving 

You lift me up in times when I wanna die intoxicated by your magic spellz you weave all the time You bring me down every time I feel alive I’m trying I'm living I'm dying this minute 

You bring me up and take me down life smacks the face I hold my ground another day to sing this song aloud I wonder can they hear me screaming 

Switch it now change the day and take whatever comes my way I gotta say that this magical spell is heaven or hell when it plays it can lighten or darken up your day push it away 

You lift me up in times when I wanna die intoxicated by your magic spellz you weave all the time You bring me down every time I feel alive I’m trying I'm living I'm dying this minute 

I try to live but they want me to cease to be I'm shedding skin cutting teeth and becoming me... Finger pointed shaming an everybody blaming What if I leave escaping This I know it’ll be here waiting Anticipating My downfall on the daily But you give all that you gave me And it saved me and it saved me and it saved me 

You lift me up in times when I wanna die intoxicated by your magic spellz you weave all the time You bring me down every time I feel alive I’m trying I'm living I'm dying this minute You lift me up in times when I wanna die intoxicated by your magic spellz you weave all the time You bring me down every time I feel alive I’m trying I'm living I'm dying this minute
