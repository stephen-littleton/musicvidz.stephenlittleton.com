Lyrics:

Do remember us,
Blue and gold,
16 teenage dream,
Not doing what we’re told,
We never thought about getting old
Reminiscing on the days

When we were young wild and innocent,
All at the same time
Did it all for the hell of it,
One hell of a ride,
Ain’t it funny how I thought,
I left it all behind
I left it all behind
I left it all behind

You make me feel
16 again
Not a care
Summer air,
You take me there,

You make me feel
16 again,
In my mind, every night,
You take me there

You make me feel
16 again
Not a care
Summer air,
You take me there,

You make me feel
16 again,
In my mind, every night,
You take me there
You take me there
You take me there

Do you remember us,
In the sweet escape,
Top down, running round, trying not to get home late
We never learnt, from our mistakes
Reminiscing on the days,

When we were young wild and innocent,
All at the same time
Did it all for the hell of it,
One hell of a ride,
Ain’t it funny how I thought,
I left it all behind
I left it all behind
I left it all behind

You make me feel
16 again
Not a care
Summer air,
You take me there,

You make me feel
16 again,
In my mind, every night,
You take me there
You take me there
You take me there

We were young wild and innocent all at the same time,
Ain’t it funny how I thought I left it all behind,
Till you looked into my eyes I realised,

You make me feel
16 again
Not a care
Summer air,
You take me there
