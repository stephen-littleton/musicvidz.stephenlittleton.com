As reported by the youtube user derbone,  

this is the very first videoclip made for 'Fun For Me', which promoted the UK single release in 1995.  

For the 1996 re-release, a second video was made (the so-called 'nurse version'), and there was even a third video in 1997, when it got finally released in the U.S., after being featured on the motion picture "Batman and Robin".
