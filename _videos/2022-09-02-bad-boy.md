Lyrics:

im a 
bad boy, doing good things  
GOT A
lemonade whip, 
CHICKEN WINGS
WID A 
BAD BITCH
AND SHE QUITE THICK

SO I MIGHT JUST COP MY SELF A CHAINS TONIGHT

SLIM SHAWTY WITH THE TANK TOP
im a
let her munch IT on my cake pop
yaya
YUNG BAE'L L'MAKE YOUR HIPS DROP

SO I MIGHT JUST TAKE YOUR WOMEN FOR A NIGHT


EVERYBODY IN THE WHOLE BUILDING
I SAID
EVERYBODY IN THE WHOLE BUILDING
COME ON
FOLLOW ALONG feel the GROOVE
AND GET YOURSELF TO MOVE

GET YOUR ASS TO THE DANCE FLOO
I SAID
GET YOUR ASS TO THE DANCE FLOO
COME ON
FOLLOW ALONG FEEL THE GROVE
THERES NO ONE TO PROVE!

move to the floor

pick a girl
pick a boy
spin em round 
like a toy

grab em hands
pull em close
push em back 
do the most

pick a girl
pick a boy
spin em round 
like a toy

grab em hands
pull em close
push em back 
do the most

PANAMARA WHIP ON THE SIDE
DAMN IM LOOKING FLY 
BABY NO MONEY AND YUNG BAE WE ON FIRE
30 MINUTE HITS YEH WHY WOULD I EVER EVEN LIE 
POP ALL NIGHT WE PACIFY

CRAZY BAD GIRLS IN MY SIGHT
THINK I NEED TRY
CONFIDENCE IS PEAKING IM A REALLY NICE GUY
ASKED THAT FINE LADY YO GIRLIE WANNA JIVE?
CANT U FEEL THESE SPARKS IGNITE

Bring a girl 
She my world 
Got her dancin 
Cmon make her twirl ,ive been

doin things all y’all cudnt dream of 
I just made another song for the people 

Dancin 
Romancing 
Turned up blacked out in a mansion 
Got the money so the drinks on me 
Got the honey so the bs on me 

Drip like a faucet 
Yeah billy saucin
3 gold chains keep me cold 
Steven Austin 

And I’m lit don’t care about tomorrow
Me and couple girls headed to the condo 

Baby no money got the bag 
And Yung bae chillin he been running up the bands
Flexed on my ex got me feeling like the man 
And all I ever do is drop hits that’s the plan
