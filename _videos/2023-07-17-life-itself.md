Lyrics  

Daddy was dumb, said that Iâ€™d be something special  
Brought me up tough but I was a gentle human  
Said that he loved each of my two million freckles  
When I grew up was gonna be a superstar  

I can't get a job so I live with my mum  
I take her money but not quite enough  
I sit in the car and I listen to static  
She said I look fat but I look fantastic  

Come back down to my knees  
Gotta get back, gotta get free  
Come back down to my knees  
Lean back now, lean back and breathe  
Come back down to my knees  
Gotta get back, gotta get free  
Come back down to my knees  
Lean back now, lean back and breathe  

I'm waking up, lost in boxes outside Tesco  
Look like a bum sipping codeine Coca-Cola  
Thought that I was northern Camden's own Flash Gordon  
Sonic ray gun, gonna be a superstar  

I can't get a job so I live with my mum  
I take her money but not quite enough  
I make my own fun in grandmama's basement  
Said I look mad, she said I look wasted  

Cut back down to my knees  
Gotta get back, gotta get free  
Cut back down to my knees  
Lean back now, lean back and breathe  
Cut back down to my knees  
Gotta get back, gotta get free  
Cut back down to my knees  
Lean back now, lean back and breathe  

Cut back down to my knees  
Gotta get back, gotta get free  
Cut back down to my knees  
Lean back now, lean back and breathe  
Cut back down to my knees  
Gotta get back, gotta get free  
Cut back down to my knees  
Lean back now, lean back and breathe  
Cut back down to my knees  
Gotta get back, gotta get free  
Cut back down to my knees  
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
