I Am Not A Human Being



LYRICS:

[Lil Wayne]

Sound like my mic is right

Ugh,

I am not a human

Shout to all my moon men

Yeah they call me tune

Got them b-tches tuned in

It's a crazy world so I stay in mine

And n-ggas don't cross the line

N-ggas stay in line

Like welfare I stay elsewhere

Hotter than a devil, n-gga hell yeah

Roc-a-bye baby, homocide baby

That's more tear drops call me cry baby

What you talkin' bout tell it to my nine

Cut your tongue out, mail it to your moms

I'm a young God, swagga un-flawed

B-tch I'm in the building, you in the front yard

Lifes a b-tch yeah, better yet a dumb broad

And I bet I can f-ck the World and make it cum hard

Yeah you boys is washed up

And I'm sh-ttin on em like two girls and one cup

Weezy baby aka bring the money home

Pull out the AK and pop ya in ya funny bone

Laugh now die later muthaf-cker

You's a b-tch like zeta phi beta muthaf-cker



[Chorus]

Yeah, I call it how I see ya

I wish I never met ya, I wouldn't wanna be ya

P-ssy ass n-gga I don't wnat your gonorrhea

P-ssy ass n-gga I don't wnat your gonorrhea

Yeah, I call it how I see ya

I wish I never met ya, I wouldn't wanna be ya

P-ssy ass n-gga I don't wnat your gonorrhea

P-ssy ass n-gga I don't wnat your gonorrhea



[Lil Wayne]

Man I'm so tired of ballin I sleep a lot now

I'll let my goons rush ya like Moscow

Gun at ya eyebrow pow pow

Man I ball hard even with 5 fouls

Yeah we in this b-tch like tampon's

Dump ya in the woods now get ya camp on

Choke hold around this sh-t cause I'm so hands on

I get high as f-ck and Polo sheets is what I lands on

Back against the wall my two feet is what I stand on

Diva in the room she blowin me just like a band horn



Got her on her knees the same knees that she be prayin' on

Now she just text her girlfriend with a capital, You can join

Yeah, what y'all wanna do I'm all ears

Smoking on that head band call that sh-t Paul Pearce

I'm just so ahead of my time like dog years

Ball like Solange, India Arie, Britney Spears



[Chorus]



[Drake]

I aaaaaam, spending much more than I'm making on these cars and these vacations

Is that too much information?

I just bought a Lambourghini, I'm not even into racing

With a windshield full of tickets cuz I live right by the station

I aaaaam, tryna figure out why you so mad at me

Yes I'm with Young Money tell the magazine stop asking me

I be with the dread with the tattoo's on his head

And a flag the colour red like a f-cking low battery (ok)

N-gga peep the sh-t I'm wylin' on

I be with your baby momma you be with your child at home

Big Mo, Big Red, two cups made of styrofoam

Big cheese big bread call that sh-t a calzone

I will break your f-cking collar bone

Us agianst the World better pick which side you on

Wayne got a Bugatti that he steady putting mileage on

And we about to kill em C4 Mr Carters home.



[Lil Wayne]

Yeah, I call it how I see ya

I wish I never met ya, I wouldn't wanna be ya

We some asshole niggas call us diarrhea

The money keep growing yep

It's gorwing like a chea

Yeah, I call it how I see it

Y'all some pussy ass niggas we should call ya gonorrhea

Uh, you keep tlakin' that shit I'mma see ya

Kill ya senorita and and fuck ya mama mia!
