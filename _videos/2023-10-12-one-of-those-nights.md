Lyrics:

[Intro: The Weeknd]
Hey, I'mma visit the sky today
Hey, I'mma dance on the clouds today
And make it rain, on everybody beneath us
Just cause they try, doesn't mean they can be us
No, nobody can be us

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I'm tryna sink in some gin
I need, I need, I need, I need
And all this Hennessy got niggas in here hating on me, on me, on me
But if the neighbors know my name then, then I'm doing something right
And if their mamas know my name, and if their homies know my name then
Then I'm doing something right
And if their girlfriends know my name
Just cos she loves you, don't mean she understands
I don't give a damn, I'll make her fuck the band
[Sample:] I love the guitars
I already know, I've seen her at my show banging out XO
And her friend's a freak
She can't feel her throat, she can't feel her knees
And I'm not tryna talk
And I'm not tryna walk
Just lift me out the club

[Hook: The Weeknd and Juicy J]
One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights
One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights
Weed blowing, champagne poppin
Got that drink flowing, champagne poppin

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Pounds of weed, Sour D
That medical for my allergies
In the hotel with your girl
For 'bout a week, shootin' a shower scene
She a bad chick like Bonnie Parker
Rolled the blunts in my flying saucer
Juicy J - the new skywalker, I'll put your ho in a body auction
When I'm having fun, I'm still getting paid
Got a whole lot of mud in my Minute Maid
Stay riding through the city with my twelve gauge
Hating ass niggas, get it any day
Got a house on the hill cost a couple of mill
Juicy J got bank like uncle Phil
Keep snow bunnies that like popping pills
Keep a double cup, I like cracking seals
Y'all niggas shit, I'm still going strong
Bought the loudpack now I'm in my zone (in my zone)
Rolls Royce got me feeling like King Tut
Got my codeine cups, bout to drink up
If you're talking about money, we can link up
Bad red boned bitch, body inked up!
Your girlfriend coming home with me
And when she alone with me, she gonna suck dick and she don't spit
Or I'mma put that bitch back on the streets
I'm kickin' it with girls that be going bi
Cos their pussy is the best and their head fire

[Hook]
One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights
One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights
Weed blowing, champagne poppin
Got that drink flowing, champagne poppin

[Outro: The Weeknd]
Girl, I'mma visit the sky today
Hey, I'mma dance on the clouds today
And make it rain, on everybody beneath us
Just cause they try, doesn't mean they can be us
No, nobody can be us

[Hook x2]
One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights
One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights
Weed blowing, champagne poppin
Got that drink flowing, champagne poppin

One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights
One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights
Weed blowing, champagne poppin
Got that drink flowing, champagne poppin
