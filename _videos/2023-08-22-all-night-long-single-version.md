"All Night Long (All Night)" From The Album "Can't Slow Down" Lyrics :   

Da, da  
Ooooh, whoa  
Well my friends  
The time has come  
Raise the roof and have some fun  

Throw away the work to be done  
Let the music play on  
Play on, play on, play on...  
Everybody sing  
Everybody dance  
Lose yourself in wild romance  
We're going to party, karamu, fiesta forever  
Come on and sing along  
We're going to party, karamu, fiesta forever  
Come on and sing along  
All night long (all night)

People dancing all in the street  
See the rhythm all in their feet  
Life is good wild and sweet  
Let the music play on  
Play on, play on, play on...  
Feel it in your heart and feel it in your soul  
Let the music take control  
We're going to party, liming, fiesta forever
