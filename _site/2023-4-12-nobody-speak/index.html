Pre-Order DJ Shadow’s New Album - Our Pathetic Age - <a href="http://smarturl.it/opastore">http://smarturl.it/opastore</a></p>

<p>DJ Shadow has unveiled the music video for the song “Nobody Speak” featuring Run The Jewels, a standout track from his album ‘The Mountain Will Fall,’ out now on Mass Appeal Records.  The video depicts a meeting of leaders that quickly descends into chaos, a scene not unlike what is unfolding in governments around the globe.  It also features appearances by DJ Shadow and Run The Jewels.</p>

<p>Says DJ Shadow: “We wanted to make a positive, life-affirming video that captures politicians at their election-year best.  We got this instead.”</p>

<p>Says Run The Jewels’ Killer Mike: “It’s such a dope video. It’s what I really wish Trump and Hillary would just do and get it over with…And even in that fight I think Hillary would win - and that’s not an endorsement.”</p>

<p>The video was directed by Sam Pilling and produced by Pulse Films, stars Igor Tsyshkevych and Ian Bailey, and was shot in NYC, London and Ukraine.</p>

<p>‘The Mountain Will Fall’ is the pioneering musician and producer’s first album in five years and finds him exploring new realms of composition and soundscapes.  The album was released in June to rave reviews, a performance with Run The Jewels on The Tonight Show, and a #1 iTunes electronic chart debut in 16 countries, including DJ Shadow’s first #1 on Billboard’s Dance / Electronic chart in U.S.   The Mountain Will Fall is available in physical and digital formats and is available here - <a href="https://DJShadow.lnk.to/TMWFNS">https://DJShadow.lnk.to/TMWFNS</a></p>

<p>In advance of his album release, he hosted another classic Essential Mix for the BBC and also did a pop-up show with Beats1 called #Radioface, with more to follow later this year.</p>

<p>Raves for ‘The Mountain Will Fall’:</p>

<p>“Brassy and bruising” – Rolling Stone</p>
