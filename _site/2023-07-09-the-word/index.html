<p>‘The Word’ on the street is that Wideboys are back with a bang and a banger! Having come through the ranks of UK garage, bassline, house and electro with a slew of big releases, their broad array of influences and refusal to be pigeon holed has led them to the freer realms at the forefront of bass music. This open-minded attitude to their productions is in full evidence with ‘The Word’, the third release on their new flagship label World Wide Phonographics.</p>

<p>No.3 in the Cool Cuts Chart<br />
Pop Justice - Song Of the Day</p>

<p>Having collaborated with Sway &amp; McLean on the much loved ‘Shopaholic’ and with Boy Better Know, Majestic and MC B-Live on ‘In The VIP’, the boys are now kicking back to the old skool Roger Troutman influenced electronic sounds of yesteryear on their latest offering and getting deep in to their much treasured talkbox synth whilst keeping the production futuristic and cutting edge.</p>

<p>“For us ‘The Word’ came about after listening to loads of people’s opinions about music and where it should and shouldn’t be. In the end you have ‘just got to do you’. It’s a personal record about belief in oneself and having confidence to place your balls on the line with what you do, and in our case that is for the music we love. That kind of vibe cannot be faked.”</p>

<p>‘The Word’ has immediately picked up support form some of the UK’s leading tastemakers. From Annie Mac and Danny Howard playing it on their Radio1 shows to Andi Durrant on Capital, Crissy Criss on 1xtra and DJ Ez &amp; Steve Smart on Kiss - where it has been added to the KISS fresh playlist – it is quickly becoming a staple in a diverse range of DJs’ record bags.</p>

<p>The single comes with a diverse selection of mixes from The Wideboys, Project Bassline, Cause N Affect, Koncept, Deckscarr, Crissy Cris and Vince Nysee. The ‘Bass Mix’ package will be released through iTunes on 14th may, with the full commercial house mix package coming on the 28th May and including the lead Radio Mix.</p>
